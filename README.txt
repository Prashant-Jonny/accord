 The Accord.NET Framework 
 http://accord-net.github.io


  The Accord.NET Framework provides machine learning, mathematics, statistics,
  computer vision, computer audition, and several scientific computing related
  methods and techniques to .NET. The project extends the popular AForge.NET 
  Framework providing a more complete scientific computing environment.
 
  This GitHub repository is a placeholder for the official project page at
  Google Code. A possibly project migration to GitHub is being evaluated.

 Installing the framework
 ------------------------

1) Download the AForge.NET Framework 2.2.5 from 
   https://code.google.com/p/aforge/downloads/list

2) Download the Accord.NET Framework from
   https://code.google.com/p/accord/downloads/list

3) Install both frameworks as described in the Getting Started Guide
   https://code.google.com/p/accord/wiki/GettingStarted?tm=6
   
   
4) If you used the automated installers, the framework binaries
   should already be available in the Add Reference dialog from
   Visual Studio. If you installed using the zip packages, you'll
   need to add references manually to your projects.
   
5) Upon installation, several sample applications will be available
   by default at
   
     C:\Program Files (x86)\Accord.NET\Framework\Samples
   
   You can open the Samples.sln solution on Visual Studio to check
   the sample applications for examples. Complete documentation is
   also available online
